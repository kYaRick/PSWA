        Well, growing up in Mlyniv I had always been
        active in the outdoors. After school I
        had worked some time for a large Vodafone company. In 2016, I graduated from art school and became
        interested
        in the Arduino platform So in 2017, I saw an opportunity
        to merge three of my passions, software, drawing and cycling. I had noticed a trend
        emerging in single speed bikes with bright colors that people had built up
        themselves. I thought this was a natural fit for customization. With a small
        initial investment, I dove in, leveraging my skills in software and ecommerce.

          Single speed bikes have become a recent cultural
          phenomenon. Sure, there are some limitations to having one gear, but there are
          also advantages. The simplicity of going back to basics is what is drawing many
          riders. No gears to tune or clicking derailleur to worry about. This low maintenance factor means you
          can
          just get on and ride.
